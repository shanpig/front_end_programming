## Hi, Shanpig here.
This project come up when I had enough with our clumsy login page of my college, thus I made another one from scratch. <br>
The page only got its front-end design, no database linking was done, but It definitely outperforms the previous login page -- in all aspects.

I haven't give it to the college yet (shh).
