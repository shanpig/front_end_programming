<h2>Shanpig-X muscle buildup</h2>
<p style="font-size:20pt">Hello, I am Shanpig, and this is my front-end programming project.<br>
This repo contains a website of muscle introduction and training videos, which can help with those who are interested in working out. Currently there is still some problems of this website such as the clickable bodypart sometimes not working, you have to refresh the page several times, or you can use the dropdown menu instead. However, the overall functionality is there. Play with it! Hope this helps with your workout plan.<br><br>  
The videos are linked to Athlean-X, the great coach Jeff's youtube videos. Go check it! He's amazing :)<br></p>
